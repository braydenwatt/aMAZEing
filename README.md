# 🌐 Multi-Platform Maze Generator 🧩

## Overview

This project is a versatile maze generation system implemented across three different platforms: Minecraft Datapack, Pygame, and Unity. Each implementation offers a unique approach to procedural maze creation, demonstrating the flexibility of maze generation algorithms.

## 🗺️ Project Components

### 1. Minecraft Datapack 🧱
A Minecraft-native maze generator that creates intricate mazes within the game world using command blocks and data pack mechanics.

- **Features**:
  - Procedural maze generation directly in Minecraft
  - Customizable maze size and complexity
  - Instant world transformation
  - Compatible with vanilla Minecraft

### 2. Pygame Maze Generator 🐍
A Python-based maze creation tool using Pygame for visualization and interaction.

- **Features**:
  - Interactive maze generation
  - Multiple maze generation algorithms
  - Real-time rendering
  - Step-by-step maze exploration
  - Export and save maze layouts

### 3. Unity Maze Display 🎮
A Unity-powered maze visualization and interaction system.

- **Features**:
  - 3D maze generation
  - Walkable maze environments
  - First-person and top-down view modes
  - Maze seed and difficulty settings
  - Potential game integration

## 🔧 Technologies Used
